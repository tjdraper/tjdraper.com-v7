preview: I've decided it's high time I started writing about software since software is what I do day in and day outâ€¦

Over the last several years I keep thinking about things I want to say regarding software, and, while I could have put them on the previous iteration of this site, this site has sort of been a mixed bag. I had personal posts, church posts, software posts, nerdy posts, Star Trek posts, etc. etc.

So, this is a sort of fresh start for my site and my "brand" (whatever that is I guess). I hope you enjoy my ramblings about software.
