title: 'About Me and My Ramblings'
---

I've been writing software since the mid-2000s, and professionally since about 2012. I've primarily written PHP, but as a full stack developer I know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript quite well. I've also had a chance to work on a C#/.Net project for about a year, and I'm pretty handy with bash scripting.

I do have an opinion or two, and I love to help educate people with what I know and what I'm learning. I hope you find my writing, videos, and other content useful, inspiring, and friendly.
